title: SSH Runtime
description: Run agents on remote hosts over SSH for security and performance
---

Mux can run workspaces on a remote host over SSH. When configured, tool operations (file reads/edits, `bash`, etc.) execute on the remote machine.

## Threat model

Mux treats the remote host as potentially hostile. By default it does **not** forward your local keys or credentials.

The only data synced to the remote machine is:

- a git archive of the project
- [Project Secrets](/config/project-secrets) (explicitly configured)

## Why use SSH runtime

- **Security**: Prompt injection risk is contained to the credentials/files on the remote machine.
  - SSH remotes pair well with [Agentic Git Identity](/config/agentic-git-identity).
- **Performance**: Run many agents in parallel without burning laptop CPU/battery.

## Host value

The host field accepts anything you can pass to `ssh <host>`:

- a hostname (for example `my-server.com`)
- a username and hostname (for example `user@my-server.com`)
- an alias from your `~/.ssh/config` (for example `my-server`)

Mux delegates SSH configuration to your system `ssh` command, so advanced settings live in `~/.ssh/config`.

Example entry:

```text
Host ovh-1
  HostName 148.113.1.1
  User root
```

## Authentication

<Info>
  Mux delegates to `ssh`. This is an abbreviated reference of common ways `ssh` authenticates.

### Local default keys

`ssh` checks these locations by default:

```text
~/.ssh/id_rsa
~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk
~/.ssh/id_ed25519
~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk
```

### SSH agent

If you have an SSH agent running, add your key:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/my_key_ecdsa
```

### `~/.ssh/config`

You can also set an explicit identity file:

```text
Host my-server
  HostName 148.113.1.1
  User root
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
