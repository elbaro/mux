description: Log in to Mux Gateway to get evaluation credits
---

Mux Gateway is an optional provider that proxies requests through Coder's
servers, so you can try supported models with evaluation credits (if eligible).
The proxy injects our API keys into LLM requests, and tracks token usage against
your credit balance.

Mux Gateway currently doesn't provide any utility other than allowing subsidized
token usage from Coder, but we may expand it in the future to have more
functionality.

## Eligibility

Currently, OSS contributors with GitHub accounts older than 12 months (or GitHub
Pro members) can receive evaluation credits after logging in.

If you're not eligible (or you run out of credits), you can still use Mux by
configuring providers directly with your own API keys.

## Mux Voucher Codes

If you receive a **Mux Voucher Code** (for example, at an event), redeem it on
the Gateway website and the credits will be applied to your GitHub account.

1. Go to [gateway.mux.coder.com](https://gateway.mux.coder.com) and sign in with
   GitHub.
2. Redeem the code.
   - The credit is assigned to the GitHub account you used to redeem it.
   - You do **not** need to paste the code into the Mux app.
3. In Mux, click **Login to Mux Gateway** and sign in with that same GitHub
   account — your updated balance should show up in Settings.

## Log in

1. Open Mux (see [install](/install) for instructions).
2. Open **Settings** (Cmd+, on macOS).
3. Under **Providers**, expand **Mux Gateway**.
4. Click **Login to Mux Gateway** and complete the browser flow.
5. Return to Mux — your Gateway balance and limits should show up in Settings.

## Enable Mux Gateway for models

1. In **Settings → Models**, turn on **Mux Gateway** for the model(s) you want
   to use.
2. Optionally, click **Star** to set a model as your default model.

## Our Ask

As Mux is in its early development stage, we highly value user feedback. Please
let us know of any issues you encounter or feature requests in [our
tracker](https://github.com/coder/mux/issues).
