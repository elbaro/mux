description: Share encrypted messages with cryptographic signatures via mux.md
---

Mux lets you share assistant messages via [mux.md](https://mux.md), an end-to-end encrypted paste service. Shared messages can be cryptographically signed to prove authorship.

## How Sharing Works

1. **End-to-end encryption**: Content is encrypted in your browser using AES-256-GCM before upload. The encryption key stays in the URL fragment and is never sent to the server.

2. **Optional signing**: When a signing key is available, Mux signs the content with your private key. Recipients can verify the signature on mux.md.

3. **Expiration**: Shares can expire after 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or never. You can change expiration after sharing.

## Message Signing

Signing proves that you authored a shared message. When enabled, mux.md displays your GitHub username alongside a "Verified" badge.

### Signing Key Discovery

Mux looks for a signing key in these locations (first match wins):

1. `~/.mux/message_signing_key` — Mux-specific key (can be a symlink)
2. `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` — Standard SSH Ed25519 key
3. `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa` — Standard SSH ECDSA key

<Tip>
  Create a symlink to use an existing key without copying: ```bash ln -s ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  ~/.mux/message_signing_key ```
</Tip>

### Supported Key Types

- **Ed25519** (recommended) — Fast, secure, 32-byte keys
- **ECDSA** — P-256, P-384, and P-521 curves supported

Encrypted keys (passphrase-protected) are skipped automatically.

### GitHub Identity Detection

To display your GitHub username on signed shares, Mux detects your identity via the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh auth status
```

If you're logged in with `gh auth login`, your GitHub username appears on mux.md alongside the signature verification.

<Note>
  GitHub CLI is optional. Without it, shares are still signed—recipients just see the public key
  fingerprint instead of your username.
</Note>

### Enabling/Disabling Signing

Click the pen icon (✏️) in the share popover to toggle signing on or off. This setting persists across sessions.

When signing is disabled or no key is found, shares are still encrypted—they just won't have a signature for verification.

## Using Shared Content in Mux

Mux can natively read mux.md URLs using the `web_fetch` tool. When you paste a mux.md link into your chat, Mux decrypts the content client-side and makes it available to the AI assistant.

This enables several workflows:

- **Cross-session sharing**: Share context or instructions between workspaces in the same Mux client
- **Team collaboration**: Send encrypted snippets to teammates who can paste them into their Mux sessions
- **Preserving context**: Save important assistant outputs and retrieve them later in new conversations

Simply paste any `https://mux.md/<id>#<key>` URL into your message, and Mux will automatically fetch and decrypt the content.

<Tip>
  The encryption key (after `#`) never leaves your client. Only the encrypted blob travels over the
  network, so shared content remains private even when fetched programmatically.
</Tip>

## Generating a Signing Key

If you don't have an SSH key, generate one:

```bash
# Ed25519 (recommended)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.mux/message_signing_key -N ""

# Or ECDSA
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 256 -f ~/.mux/message_signing_key -N ""
```

The `-N ""` flag creates a key without a passphrase (required for Mux to use it automatically).
